o	Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
o	Indicate how often an audit should be performed
o	Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees
 
<b>Complete a risk assessment</b>
•	A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).
 
<b>Conduct the audit</b>
•	When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.
 
<b>Create a mitigation plan</b>
•	A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 
 
<b>Communicate results to stakeholders</b>
•	The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
