| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
Control Name	Control type and explanation


Least Privilege	Preventative; reduces risk by making sure vendors and non-authorized staff only have access to the assets/data they need to do their jobs		
Disaster recovery plans	Corrective; business continuity to ensure systems are able to run in the event of an incident/there is limited to no loss of productivity downtime/impact to system components, including: computer room environment (air conditioning, power supply, etc.); hardware (servers, employee equipment); connectivity (internal network, wireless); applications (email, electronic data); data and restoration		
Password policies	Preventative; establish password strength rules to improve security/reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques		
Access control policies	Preventative; increase confidentiality and integrity of data		
Account management policies	Preventative; reduce attack surface and limit overall impact from disgruntled/former employees		
Separation of duties	Preventative; ensure no one has so much access that they can abuse the system for personal gain		




Technical Controls
Control Name	Control type and explanation
	Needs to be implemented
(X)	Priority

Firewall
	Preventative; firewalls are already in place to filter unwanted/malicious traffic from entering internal network		
Intrusion Detection System (IDS)	Detective; allows IT team to identify possible intrusions (e.g., anomalous traffic) quickly		
Encryption
	Deterrent; makes confidential information/data more secure (e.g., website payment transactions)		
Backups	Corrective; supports ongoing productivity in the case of an event; aligns to the disaster recovery plan		
Password management system	Corrective; password recovery, reset, lock out notifications		
Antivirus (AV) software	Corrective; detect and quarantine known threats		
Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention	Preventative/corrective; required for legacy systems to identify and mitigate potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities		






Physical Controls
Control Name	Control type and explanation
	Needs to be implemented
(X)	Priority

Time-controlled safe	Deterrent; reduce attack surface/impact of physical threats		
Adequate lighting	Deterrent; limit “hiding” places to deter threats		
Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance	Preventative/detective; can reduce risk of certain events; can be used after event for investigation		
Locking cabinets (for network gear)	Preventative; increase integrity by preventing unauthorized personnel/individuals from physically accessing/modifying network infrastructure gear		
Signage indicating alarm service provider	Deterrent; makes the likelihood of a successful attack seem low		
Locks	Preventative; physical and digital assets are more secure		
Fire detection and prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.)	Detective/Preventative; detect fire in the toy store’s physical location to prevent damage to inventory, servers, etc.
