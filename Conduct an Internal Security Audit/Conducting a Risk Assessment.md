<h4>Risk description</h4> <br>


Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. <br>

  
<h4>Control best practices</h4><br>
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity. <br>

<h4>Risk score</h4><br>

On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.<br>

<h4>Additional comments</h4><br>
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be lost. The likelihood of a lost asset or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards related to keeping customer data private.
